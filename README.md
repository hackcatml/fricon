# fricon-swift
Frida download, install, etc command line tool<br>
It temporarily supports rootless by patching the original `frida_{version}_iphoneos-arm.deb` file (tested on iPhoneX iOS 15.6.1 using palera1n rootless JB)<br>

# Usage
It depends on `curl`, `fakeroot` (for rootless)<br>
Install those dependencies from Sileo first<br>
Other than that, It's ready to serve you :)
